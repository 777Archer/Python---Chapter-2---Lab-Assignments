# Total Purchase
A customer in a store is purchasing five items. 
Write a program that asks for the price of each item, and then displays the subtotal of the 
sale, the amount of sales tax, and the total. Assume the sales tax is 7 percent. 

Hint: You shouldn't use spaces to pad the numbers, but rather format them using format function, 
e.g. format(x, "10,.2f").
